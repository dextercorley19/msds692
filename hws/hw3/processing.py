    """
    Aggregate 40 lines of a DataFrame into one line for a given period.

    This function processes a DataFrame containing both static columns, whose values
    do not change within a given period, and time series columns, whose values are variable.
    It returns a dictionary where the keys are column names. For time series columns,
    the values are lists of 40 numbers, and for static columns, the values are single numbers.
    Before returning, the dictionary is converted into a pandas Series.

    Args:
        df (pd.DataFrame): The DataFrame for a specific period containing 40 rows.
        static_cols (list of str): List of column names that are static 
                                  (values do not change within the period).
        time_cols (list of str): List of column names that are time series

    """
    Process all periods in a DataFrame by aggregating data for each unique key.

    This function groups the input DataFrame by the "key" column and applies the
    specified `process_time_period` function to each group. It aggregates the rows
    based on the provided static and time series columns. The result is a new DataFrame
    containing the aggregated data for each unique key.

    Args:
        df (pd.DataFrame): The DataFrame containing the data to be processed.
                           It must include a "key" column to group by.

        time_cols (list of str): A list of column names representing time series columns,
                                  whose values vary within the grouped periods.
        process_time_period (function): A function that processes individual periods

        col: str: Column used for aggregation.

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame containing the aggregated results for each unique key.
                      Each row corresponds to a unique key from the original DataFrame.
