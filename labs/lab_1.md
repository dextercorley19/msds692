# Scraping Country Information from Wikipedia

## Objective

Create a Jupyter Notebook that scrapes information about countries and their populations from Wikipedia and stores it in a CSV file.

### Website to Scrape

The data can be found at the following link:

[Wikipedia: List of Countries and Dependencies by Population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population)

### CSV File Structure

The resulting CSV file should have two columns:

- **country**: The name of the country or dependency.
- **population**: The population of the country or dependency.
