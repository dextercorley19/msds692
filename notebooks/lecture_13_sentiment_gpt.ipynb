While most TV movies border on the brink of mediocrity, this film actually has some redeeming qualities to it. The cinematography was pretty good for a TV film, and Viggo Mortensen displays shades of Aragorn in a film about a man who played by his own rules. Most of the flashback sequences were kind of cheesy, but the scene with the mountain lion was intense. I was kind of annoyed by Jason Priestly's role in the film as a rebellious shock-jock, but then again, it's a TV MOVIE! Despite all of the good things, the soundtrack was atrocious. However, it was nice to see Tucson, Arizona prominently featured in the film.\""

Not that Henry Fonda wasn\\'t good but the character he played was nothing but a loon. Do you mean to tell me that Lincoln was a wise cracking smart ass with no respect of the law or the court. I mean who the hell was he supposed to be? Cousin Vinnie? I mean come on, \"I\\'ll just call you Jackass then\"???? I understand that Ford was going for great funny hero guy but I didn\\'t really like this guy at all. He cheats in sports, talks like a real sweet simpleton and does not seem to know were to sit in a courtroom. How am I supposed to take this seriously.<br /><br />The twist was even weaker. I mean come on! That was just stupid. The whole story seemed like it was thought up by some 5 year old in his or her dreams. Saying that I liked it enough, it was very entertaining and made me laugh at several occasions so I can\\'t say it\\'s a bad film. In fact I must say that I must say it\\'s good enough, nothing that entertains me and makes me laugh can be bad BUT this vivid and silly story was just so ridiculous that I can\\'t understand how anyone could consider it great.<br /><br />I have no idea how historically accurate this film was but if any of it was true I would really have to shake my head.',\n",

If you're a bad movie fan like I am, this is great material. If, however, you are looking for any sort of meaningful plot, acting ability, or movie-making skill, this is best avoided. The best part is how they filmed all the fighting sequences in stuttering fast-forward. Hilariously bad.

       " ('From the first time I saw the box cover of the movie and the stretched out photography I thought this guy, this friend of the \\'Scwarz\\' must be like 6 foot or 6ft 2in. <br /><br />Not 5 feet tall. Not that, it\\'s his fault. <br /><br />At any rating, I turned on the movie one cool night in Tucson, out on the second story-deck with a good cigar and let it roll. At that time my wife was having an affair and things were going down hill for me, so I needed a good diversion. But, as bad as the movie was...I totally enjoyed it, with a bottle of Merlot too, I might admit. <br /><br />Truly, I have watched this movie many times. It always makes me feel good!! It\\'s not that it \\'tries too hard\\' to be cool or that \\'It\\'s so close\\' to hitting the mark for an action film....It\\'s frantic. And then truly clueless. Then frantic again. It\\'s the best of the best when it comes to a slow speed chase scene. Wow!! I never felt safer in my life. Warm and happy too. I was thankful that they conserved on the gasoline during the chase, due to less production in the summer months...anywho <br /><br />The direction was \\'uninspired\\' the action and fight sequences needed to be choreographed, or re-choreographed and tightened up, the sound was off the delivery didn\\'t hit you, it just kept on going, the other way. The \\'locals\\' of that village that they were in, the town rather, were \\'Off cue\\' they also did not seem to follow what was happening very well, the would look and even \\'stare\\' into the camera lens. Like a deer in the head lights kind of thing only some of them with a smile, a smiling deer. <br /><br />I feel bad because \\'Columbu\\' I just bet has a good heart and a caring spirit for people in America as well as for his own countrymen. <br /><br />However \"Baretta\\'s Island\" is very lethargic and unbelievable. Even still I like it a lot. My now x-wife hates it, but I love it! <br /><br />The funny thing is, I am pretty discriminating when it comes to movies I like or even \\'love\\'. All in all, I like Franco. So there it is. <br /><br />As a movie adding addendum to this if you like killing a few hours with truly fun to watch, straight to video-B movies or \\'bad\\' movies for your little library collection then, if you can find it, check out \\'The Big Sweat\\' (1991) with Robert Z\\' Dar..you know the big guy from \\'TANGO & CASH\\'. \\'The Big Sweat\\', a bomb of a cop story with no real plot discovery and acting that is so lame, it might as well be \\'on crutches\\' and at the end of \\'The Big Sweat\\' I think they ran out of money, because they had a picture of the cast and just set it on fire and let it burn during the credits. -Good fun. <br /><br />But all in all, not as good as Baretta\\'s Island\\', I gave it a \\'1\\' and an overall rating of \\'awful\\' for awful-good B\\' movie. I\\'m waiting for the sequel, maybe like \\'Baretta\\'s revenge on Montazuma\\' (Franco takes a Mexican vacation and gets sick on the water then, declares war on the water co.) or \\'Baretta\\'s powder war\\' where as he would stake out a large drug lord in his country and chemically gene-splice and create a hybrid super bug (insect) that would be bred and dropped into the cocaine fields and eat the coke and upon passing it through the bug, it forms a chemical reaction that turns the coke to pure powdered sugar. Then another sequel he would have to get the young people rescued from excessive sugar addiction and so on. He could get a major tooth paste company to endorse and partially fund the project with careful product placement in the feature. Right?(*)',\n",

       " (\"Mitchell Leisen's fifth feature as director, and he shows his versatility by directing a musical, after his previous movies were heavy dramas. He also plays a cameo as the conductor.<br /><br />You can tell it is a pre code movie, and nothing like it was made in the US for quite a while afterwards (like 30+ years). Leisen shot the musical numbers so they were like what the audience would see - no widescreen shots or from above ala Busby Berkeley. What I do find funny or interesting is that you never actually see the audience.<br /><br />As others have mentioned the leads are fairly characterless, and Jack Oakie and Victor McLaghlan play their normal movie personas. Gertrude Michael however provides a bit of spark.<br /><br />The musical numbers are interesting and some good (the Rape of the Rhapsody in particular is amusing) but the drama unconvincing and faked - three murders is too many and have minimal emotional impact on the characters. This is where this movie could have been a lot better.\",\n",
